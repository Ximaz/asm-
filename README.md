# ASM++

The purpose of this project is to create a wrapper around NASM Intel x86_64 assembly language to make functions, conditions and loops more beginner-friendly. To do so, this project will have to parse custom keywords and replace them with an actual assembly code into a separate file.

### Contributions

I'll likely accept no contributions to this project as it's made to teach myself things, not to be a real project. More like a toy-one. If you really want to contribute to such a project, go to [Code Nybble's repository](https://github.com/Thomas-de-Bock/construct).
